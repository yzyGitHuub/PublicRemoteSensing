## A_OPTRAM-ET
An automatic optical trapezoid model for evapotranspiration estimation, developed on Google Earth Engine, driven by optical remote sensing, including Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-8 OLI, Sentinel-2 SLI, Terra MODIS(Yao et al., ISPRS P&RS, 2024). 

## BERTH
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Hydrology (BERTH), is a large model for quantifying hydrological remote sensing, including precipitation, surface soil moisture, evapotranspiration and runoff (Yao et al., to be submitted, 2025).

## Irrigated Area Mapping
