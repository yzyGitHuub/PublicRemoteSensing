# BERTH
## Description
The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Hydrology (BERTH) is a large model for quantifying hydrology encoded in remote sensing, including precipitation (P), surface soil moisture (SM), evapotranspiration (ET), and runoff (RO). The pretrained BERTH can be found in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_PXdJh9Qqq1aTYyDsOtq7kpp0q4dO5pw?usp=sharing). BERTH shows state-of-the-art performances in global hydrological remote sensing.
