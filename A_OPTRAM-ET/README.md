# A_OPTRAM-ET: An automatic optical trapezoid model for evapotranspiration estimation and its global-scale assessment

## Abstract
Remotely sensed evapotranspiration (ET) with high resolution has wide-ranging applications in agriculture, hydrology and meteorology. The original optical trapezoid model for ET (O_OPTRAM-ET) does not need thermal remote sensing and shows potential value in ET estimation at high resolution. However, this non-automated O_OPTRAM-ET heavily relies on visual interpretation or optimization with in situ measurements, which limits its practical value. In this study, a Spatial Temporal Aggregated Regression algorithm (STAR) was proposed to develop an automatic trapezoid model for ET (A_OPTRAM-ET), implemented within the Google Earth Engine environment, and evaluated at global scale. With the involvement of aggregation algorithm at multiple levels to automatically determine its parameters, A_OPTRAM-ET can fast run without any ground measurements as input. Evaluation with in situ ET shows that the proposed A_OPTRAM-ET has good ability to estimate ET on various land cover types and satellites. The overall RMSE, MAE, and CC against in situ LE measurements are 35.5 W·m-2 (41.3 W·m-2, 40.0 W·m-2, 36.1 W·m-2,), 26.3 W·m-2 (28.9 W·m-2, 28.7 W·m-2, 25.8 W·m-2,), and 0.78 (0.73, 0.70, 0.72) for Sentinel-2 (Landsat-8, Landsat-5, MOD09GA). A_OPTRAM-ET shows stable accuracy over long time periods (about 10 years). Compared with other published ET datasets, ET estimated by A_OPTRAM-ET is better with the land cover types of cropland and shrubland. A_OPTRAM-ET reveals similar trend of global ET during 2001-2020 with other published ET datasets and provides more spatial details. Therefore, the proposed A_OPTRAM-ET model can estimate ET efficiently at high resolution at global scale and has significant practical value in agriculture, hydrology, and other fields.
